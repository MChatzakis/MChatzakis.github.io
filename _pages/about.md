I am a Computer Science MSc student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and currently a research intern at [CEA, Paris](https://www.cea.fr/), where I work on topics of scalable time series similarity search for seismic data collections. 

<!-- I am particurarly interested for distributed time series similarity search and machine learning. -->

Before EPFL, I obtained by BSc from the [Computer Science Department, University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), where I graduated first in class in July 2022.

I am collaborating with [Dino Group, Universite Paris Cite](https://dino.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) and professors [Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) and [Panagiota Fatourou](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~faturu/) since 2021, on topics of scalable distributed similarity search.

During the summer of 2022, I joined [DIAS]() lab of EPFL, where I collaborated with professor [Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki/?lang=en) and [Viktor Sanca](https://www.viktorsanca.com/) on the enhancement of relation operators with vector embeddings. 

During my early days in University of Crete, I collaborated with [FORTH-ICS](https://www.forth.gr/en/home/) and professor [Yannis Tzitzikas](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~tzitzik/) in topics of Open Linked Data and Knowledge Graphs.
