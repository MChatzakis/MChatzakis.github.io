I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and I am a thesis student at the [University of Paris](https://u-paris.fr/en/), working under the supervision of Professor [Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) on exact and approximate similarity search for high-dimensional data, including data series.

From February 2024 to August 2024, I was a research intern at the [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/) in Paris, where I focused on scalable time series subsequence similarity search (template matching) for large seismic data collections.

In the summer of 2022, I joined the [DIAS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/) lab at EPFL, where I collaborated with Professor [Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki/?lang=en) and Dr. [Viktor Sanca](https://www.viktorsanca.com/) to develop an enhanced context-awar relational string-join operator using deep learning word embeddings.

Prior to my studies at EPFL, I earned my Bachelor's degree from the [Computer Science Department at the University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), graduating first in my class in July 2022.

Since 2021, I have been collaborating with the [Dino Group, University of Paris](https://dino.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) under the supervision of Professors [Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) and [Panagiota Fatourou](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~faturu/), working on distributed large-scale data series similarity search.

Earlier, I was a research assistant at [FORTH-ICS](https://www.forth.gr/en/home/), working with Professor [Yannis Tzitzikas](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~tzitzik/) and Dr. [Michalis Mountantonakis](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~mountant/) on Open Linked Data and Knowledge Graphs.

Throughout my academic journey, I have received several awards and scholarships, including undergraduate scholarships from the University of Crete, and graduate scholarships from the [Latsis Foundation](https://www.latsis-foundation.org/eng) and the [Onassis Foundation](https://www.onassis.org/). I was also honored to participate as a young computer scientist in the [9th Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/forum/9th-hlf-2022.html).
