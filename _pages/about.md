I am a Computer Science MSc student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and currently a research intern at [CEA in Paris](https://www.cea.fr/), where I focus on <i>scalable time series similarity search for seismic data collections</i>. 

<!-- I am particurarly interested for distributed time series similarity search and machine learning. -->

Before EPFL, I obtained by BSc from the [Computer Science Department, University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), where I graduated first in class in July 2022.

Since 2021, I am collaborating with [Dino Group, Universite Paris Cite](https://dino.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) and professors [Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) and [Panagiota Fatourou](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~faturu/), working on topics of <i>distributed data series similarity search</i>.

During the summer of 2022, I joined [DIAS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/) lab of EPFL, where I collaborated with professor [Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki/?lang=en) and [Viktor Sanca](https://www.viktorsanca.com/) to create an <i>enhanced relational string-join operator using deep learning word embeddings</i>

During my early days in University of Crete, I was a research assistant at [FORTH-ICS](https://www.forth.gr/en/home/) working with professor [Yannis Tzitzikas](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~tzitzik/) and Dr. [Michalis Mountantonakis](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~mountant/) in topics of <i>Open Linked Data and Knowledge Graphs</i>.

Throughout my studies I have received several awards, including undergraduate and graduate scholarships from University of Crete, [Latsis Foundation](https://www.latsis-foundation.org/eng), and [Onassis Foundation](https://www.onassis.org/), while I was also selected to participate as a young scientist in the [9th HLF](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/forum/9th-hlf-2022.html).

My detailed CV is available [here](https://mchatzakis.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

<!--Sometimes, I write about travellings experiences, movies and video games in my blog.-->

<!-- When I am not busy with Computer Science-related stuff, I am either travelling, playing Video Games or watching movies. Video Games are my passion since I remember myself, and I sometimes write my experiences with video game titles. -->
