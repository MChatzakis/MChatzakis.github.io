I am an incoming doctoral candidate at the [diNo](http://dino.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) Research Group of [University of Paris](https://u-paris.fr/en/), 
working with Professor [Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) on topics of efficient Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) for high-dimensional data. 

I have obtained my MSc Computer Science degree from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland, 
and my BSc Computer Science degree from the [University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en) in Greece, where I graduated first in my class.

I have interned at several institutions, including the [Commision of Atomic Energy (CEA)](https://www.cea.fr/) in Paris, 
the [DIAS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/) lab of EPFL in Switzerland ([summer@epfl](https://summer.epfl.ch/)), 
and the [FORTH-ICS](https://www.forth.gr/en/home/) in Greece.

I am honored to have received several awards and scholarships, including undergraduate scholarships from the University of Crete, 
and graduate scholarships from the [Latsis Foundation](https://www.latsis-foundation.org/eng) and the [Onassis Foundation](https://www.onassis.org). 
I was also honored to participate as a young computer scientist in the [9th Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/forum/9th-hlf-2022.html).
