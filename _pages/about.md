I am a Computer Science MSc student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and currently a research intern at [CEA, Paris](https://www.cea.fr/), where I work on topics of scalable time series similarity search for seismic data collections. I am particurarly interested for distributed time series similarity search and machine learning.

Before EPFL, I obtained by BSc from the Computer Science Department of University of Crete, where I graduated first in class in July 2022.

I am collaborating with [Universite Paris Cite]() and professors [Themis Palpanas]() and [Panagiota Fatourou]() since 2021, on topics of scalable distributed similarity search.

During the summer of 2022, I joined [DIAS] lab of EPFL, where I collaborated with professor [Anastasia Ailamaki]() and [Viktor Sanca]() on the enhancement of relation operators with vector embeddings. 


During my early days in University of Crete, I collaborated with FORTH-ICS and professor [Yannis Tzitzikas]() in topics of Open Linked Data and Knowledge Graphs.
